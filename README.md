# Shunting Yard Algorithm
My own implementation of [Shunting Yard Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting_yard_algorithm) for mathematical expression evaluation.

This project is just a learning experience for my current project, which is a programming language 
called [idk](https://github.com/HicaroD/idk), and I need that algorithm for evaluating mathematical and logical expressions.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10

## Why `Python 3.10`?
I'm gonna be using some fancy features of the new version of Python, such as match-case statements.
