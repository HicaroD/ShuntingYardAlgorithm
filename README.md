# Shunting Yard Algorithm
My own implementation of [Shunting Yard Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting_yard_algorithm) for mathematical expression evaluation.

This project is just a learning experience for my current project, which is a programming language 
called [idk](https://github.com/HicaroD/idk), and I need that algorithm for evaluating mathematical and logical expressions

## Requirements

You will need `Python 3.10` to use that program.
